# Rust Traits in Substrate

* [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/substrate-seminar/8)
* [Shawn Tabrizi - Substrate Trait Tutorial](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/substrate-trait-tutorial)

This Substrate Workshop explains how Substrate uses Rust Traits to share Types between pallets.

I've added various comments to the code to explain different things that occurred to me as I was working through the examples.

Some things this code demonstrates:
* How to use Generic Bounds w/ impl
* How to use a Trait to group a series of Generic Bounds
